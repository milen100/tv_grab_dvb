.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B tv_grab_dvb
command.
After tuning your DVB tuner to a multiplex using \fBczap\fP, \fBszap\fP, \fBtzap\fP or any other tuning programm, \fBtv_grab_dvb\fP can be used to convert the data from the Event Information Table (EIT) into an xmltv listing.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.BI \-i\  path
Read data from \fIpath\fP instead of \fB/dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0\fP.
\fIpath\fP might specify an alternative demultiplexer device node or a file,
which contains captured EIT data.
\fB\-\fP is interpreted as stdin.
.TP
.BI \-f\  file
Write output to \fIfile\fP instead of stdout.
.TP
.BI \-t\  timeout
Overwrite the \fItimeout\fP in seconds, after which \fBtv_grab_dvb\fP exits, if no new data arrives that long.
.TP
.BI \-o\  offset
Additional offset in hours from \fB\-12\fP to \fB12\fP to add to any time stamp.
.TP
.B \-c
Use channel identifiers from the file \fBchanidents\fP instead of \fIsidnumber\fP\fB.dvb.guide\fP.
.TP
.B \-d
Show all shows, even when their start-date is before yesterday or after two weeks from now.
.TP
.B \-n
Show only shows on now or later, but not before.
.TP
.B \-m
Show only shows on now or later of the currently tuned multiplex.
.TP
.B \-p
Show only shows on now or later of other multiplexes than the currently tuned one.
.TP
.B \-s
Silent mode, disables status output of received packets and shows.
.TP
.B \-u
Allow output of updated info, disables filtering out duplicate shows.
Might result in multiple entries for a show.
.TP
.BI \-e\  encoding
Overwrite default character encoding used instead of \fBISO6937\fP.
DVB supports multiple character encodings.
But many stations seem to think, that \fBISO8859\-1\fP is used when no explicit encoding is given.
Since this is not so, the default character encoding can be changed to any encoding listed by \fBiconv \-l\fP.
.SH BUGS
Rule number one:
It's the fault of your broadcast station.
The information transmitted varies greatly and there is no simple way to extract useful information from many stations data.
\fBtv_grab_dvb\fP can't create data from thin air and text parsing becomes very ugly very fast.
Please bear this in mind when you start complaining.
.PP
If \fBtv_grab_dvb\fP segfaults or reports an error, please try to capture some data using \fBdvbsnoop \-s sec 18 \-b \-n 200 > file\fP, until you're able to reproduce the bug using \fBtv_grab_dvb \-i file \-o /dev/null\fP.
Than please send us that file.
